# Spherical Harmonics Plotter

This repository contains a Python script and a Tkinter GUI application for visualizing spherical harmonics. These are important mathematical functions used in various scientific and engineering fields.

[![Spherical Harmonics](spherical_harmonics.png)](spherical_harmonics.png)  ## Introduction

Spherical harmonics are a set of special functions that form a complete and orthonormal basis for solutions to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates. They have applications in quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, geophysics, computer graphics, and many other areas.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical computing.
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
- `scipy`: For scientific computing, including the `sph_harm` function.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/spherical-harmonics-plotter.git](https://github.com/your_username/spherical-harmonics-plotter.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spherical-harmonics-plotter
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python spherical_harmonics_plotter.py
   ```

2. A Tkinter GUI window will appear. Enter values for the angular momentum quantum number (`l`) and the magnetic quantum number (`m`) into the designated fields.
3. Click the "Plot" button to visualize the corresponding spherical harmonic function.

## How It Works

The script follows these steps:

1. **Input**: Users provide values for `l` and `m` through the Tkinter GUI.
2. **Calculation**: The script calculates the spherical harmonics using the `sph_harm` function from `scipy.special`.
3. **Coordinate Transformation**: Spherical coordinates `(theta, phi)` are converted to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y, z)`.
4. **Plotting**: `matplotlib` is used to generate a 3D surface plot based on the calculated Cartesian coordinates.

## Equation

The spherical harmonic function for the point (0, 0) is represented by the equation:

$$Y(0, 0) = (-1)^{\max(m, 0)} \frac{2^{1 + (1 - m)!} \pi}{m! l!} \cos(\theta) e^{im\theta} \frac{4}{(1 + m)!}$$

Here's a breakdown of the equation:

- `Y(0, 0)`: The function value at the point (0, 0).
- `(-1)^{\max(m, 0)}`: The sign factor, determined by the maximum of `m` and 0.
- `2^{1 + (1 - m)!}`: A term involving the factorial of (1 - `m`).
- `\pi`: The mathematical constant pi.
- `\frac{m! l!}{m! l!}`: A normalization factor.
- `\cos(\theta)`: The cosine function of the colatitude `theta`.
- `e^{im\theta}`: The exponential term with the imaginary unit `i`.
- `\frac{4}{(1 + m)!}`: Another normalization factor.

## Example

Setting `l = 1` and `m = 0` would plot the spherical harmonic function corresponding to the ground state orbital of a hydrogen atom.
